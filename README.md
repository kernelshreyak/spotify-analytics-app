# Spotify Analytics App

A Streamlit-powered dashboard for visualizing your Spotify listening habits. Unlike online analytics platforms, this app runs entirely on your local machineâ€”your Spotify data is never uploaded to any third-party servers. All data processing happens privately and securely on your computer, giving you full control over your listening analytics. The app uses the Spotify Web API (via Spotipy) to fetch your top artists and tracks, providing interactive analytics and visualizations.

## Features

- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Securely connect to your Spotify account.
- **Top Artists & Tracks**: View your top 20 artists and tracks for the medium-term period.
- **Popularity & Followers**: See artist popularity and follower counts.
- **Artist Presence in Top Tracks**: Visual breakdown of how many top tracks each artist has.
- **Detailed Track Listings**: Expandable sections to see your top tracks by each artist.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Tables and bar charts powered by Streamlit and Plotly.
